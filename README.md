## Test Task using Laravel

This is a test task within the Laravel framework usage.
All additional dependencies (e.g. vue, vite, inertia)from the main branch have been removed to simplify the demonstration of the first version of the workflow. I use additional dependencies (e.g. vue, vite, inertia, tailwindcss) in another branch, please see in the list of [branches](https://github.com/yukal/test_task/branches).

See the [task description](_workflow/task-en.md), and the [workflow](_workflow).

## Init

```bash
# Install dependencies

# For unix systems run bash script

# For windows systems run cmd script:
# (or run step-by-step commands from the init file)
init.cmd
```

## Run

```bash
# ( ! ) Make sure you run init before starting

# To serve in dev mode type
